Accompanying code for the paper "Data-Driven Stabilisation of Unstable Periodic Orbits of The Three-Body Problem". The pre-print can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08630. This code can hopefully provide some intuition about the method and results, as well as enabling other applications of this method.
The MATLAB Robust control toolbox is required to solve the LMIs. The code for the SINDy algorithm is the work of Steve Brunton et. al., and the functions for computing the Monodromy matrix are adapted from the work of Shane Ross.
